I have a need to get that leather away from the place where deer caracsses will be.

Otherwise the entire production chain:

 hunters bringing in fresh kills
 butchers butchering the animals for meat
 cooks cooking the meat into meals
 
stops working.

To that end, Clear the Stockpiles adds a new hauling WorkGiver which removes blockages.
